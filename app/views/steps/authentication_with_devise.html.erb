<h1 class="page-header">Adding Authentication with Devise</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Devise is a flexible authentication solution for Rails based on Warden.</p>
  <p>Warden is a Rack-based middleware, designed to provide a mechanism for authentication in Ruby web applications.  It is a common mechanism that fits into the Rack Machinery to offer powerful options for authentication.</p>
  <p>Devise is a complete MVC solution based on Rails engines and a modularity concept: use just what you really need.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    We will install an authentication system to prevent hackers, thieves, robots and other undesirable guests from accessing our data.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><h4>Add Devise to your dependency list</h4></li>
    <li><h4>Ask bundle to update your dependencies</h4></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>To add <code>Devise</code> to your application, simply tell <code>Bundler</code> to load it from <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems">rubygems.org</a></p>
  <p>Start by adding the following line to your <code>Gemfile</code></p>
  <pre><code class='ruby'>gem 'devise'</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Run <code>bundle</code> from the terminal to add <code>Devise</code> to your application</p>
  <pre><code class='ruby'>bundle</code></pre>
  <p>
    <a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler</a> provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed.
  </p>
  <p>Bundler is an exit from dependency hell, and ensures that the gems you need are present in development, staging, and production.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Use the <code>Devise</code> generator to generator an <code>initializer</code>. Read more on <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/initialization.html">Rails Initialization Process</a>
  </p>
  <pre><code class="ruby">rails g devise:install</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Explanation</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    From <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html">Getting Started with Engines</a> Rails Guide:
  </p>
  <p>
    Engines can be considered miniature applications that provide functionality to
    their host applications. A Rails application is actually just a "supercharged"
    engine, with the <code>Rails::Application</code> class inheriting a lot of its behavior
    from <code>Rails::Engine</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a> and observe the folder architecture.
  </p>
  <p>Now is also a good time to have a look at <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/">Ruby Toolbox</a>. Ruby Toolbox is a giant categorized collection of available gems with some meta data associated to it. You can easily find the gem you're looking for and see if it is still under development.</p>
